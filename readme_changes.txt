third version that is compilable
1,Add the FindModelPointCbasedOnGeodesicDistance function in miiMinPathModel;
2,Cout the NMPosi and VPosi to the Posi.txt which means the model vector indexs(start and end of the vector).

<2015-10-16> 
fourth version that is compilable
1,Create an 3D array to export the Alive Points(extract from Narraw Band),Active(Narraw Band)Points, and BackTrack Points of minimal path into a "nii.gz" file.Intensity of the three different kinds of points are set to  50, 20 and 100 respectively.
2,Creat an app called zxhcaeDMPSimulation.cpp to simulate the reference as different models.
<2015-11-3>
1,modify the FastMarchingEvolution UpWind FastMarchinginit into new ones.
2,resave intensity and vesselness into m_sUnseenImgIntensity and m_sNormVes respectively and calculate the potential value in the Upwind function instead of multiplying them before FastMarchingRevolution.
<2015-11-10>
1,Add the zxhcaeDMPMultiResolution filter into the code which is complied 
2,Update the three methods called fastmarchingevolution,newfastmarchingevolution,modifiedfastmarchingevolution and so on.

<2015-11-11>

<2015-11-17>
1,Both of Resolution and DMP increase windowing threshold from50 to 200.
2,Simulation sets reference points intensity based on only one corresponding position.
3,Updating intensity based on mean value of a variable range.
<2015-11-18>
1,I have add the model correction without moving the model to the code, and the results of the segment length are longer than previous one.
2,In addition I have change the length calculation approach in FindminPath() which has skipped some kinds of points. 
<2015-12-02>
1,I have divided the m_nModelPos into m_nOneSegModelVectorStartPos and m_nOneSegModelVectorEndPos
<2015-12-03>
1, If the distance of Point C and endpoint of the model smaller than 1mm, the endpoint will be Point C （CorrectModelPointBasedSegLengthdontMoveModel）. Updating segment-point will find Point D backward（UpdateModelSgmtPoint）. Next model vector used for next segmentation (also last segmentation) will be Point D->Point C.
<2015-12-14>
1,Change the names of 3 apps folders.
   1)zxhcaeDMPMultiModel->zxhcaeDMPMToNewImg//map points to new image.
   2)zxhcaeDMPMultiResolution->zxhcaeDMPResoImage
   3)zxhcaeDMPSimulation->zxhcaeDMPSimuModel
   4)zxhcaeDMP->zxhcaeDMP_1.0

<2016-01-14>
1,add badpoints detection into zxhcaeDMP_1.0
2,zxhcaeDMP_1.0_WM is the original one that extrction didn't reach the end of reference.
<2016-01-14>

1,zxhcaeDMP_1.0_WM is the new one that extrction fastmarchingevolution has the badpointdetection and linemask.
<2016-01-18>
1,ModifiedFastMarchingEvolutiondontMoveModelwithMask()has a longger centerline results ,however, ModifiedFastMarchingEvolutiondontMoveModelwithFindMinPathPointCwithMask() has some problems to solve;
<2016-01-23>
1,To add some function to get the average status of segmentpoint ,forwardsegmentpoint ,and segmentvector;
2,To improve the function of finding C Points which combines the tangentplane distance and nearest distance insdead of single tangentplane.
<2016-01-23>
1,After testing the zxhcaeDMP_1.0_WM to get the centerline with mask, I modified the zxhcaeDMP_1.0_WM into zxhcaeDMP_1.1 as a new one, which extracts the low resolution images doesn't use mask.
2,I have use the two kinds of methods(zxhcaeDMP_1.1,zxhcaeDMP_1.0_WM)to tesing 20 simumodel from deforming referece. However, the current code also has few bit error results.
